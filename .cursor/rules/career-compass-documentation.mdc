# Career Compass: Project Alignment

This project is **Career Compass** — a web-based career guidance platform for university students (Holland Code/RIASEC aptitude test, recommendations, career explorer).

## Single Source of Truth

**Always use the project documentation** for features, requirements, and conventions:

- **File:** `career_compass__all_documentation.md` (project root)

**Before implementing or changing features, read or reference this doc** so work stays aligned with:

- **Features & PRD:** F001–F010 (auth, Holland test, scoring, recommendations, career DB, explorer, detail view, persistence, responsive, career generation)
- **Tech stack:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Supabase, Vercel
- **Data model:** `profiles`, `career_tests`, `careers`, `saved_careers`; API routes and RLS as documented
- **Recommendation logic:** RIASEC scoring (18 questions, 3 per dimension), top-2 match, `primary_riasec` alignment
- **Design:** Primary Blue `#2563EB`, Accent Green `#10B981`, Inter font, mobile-first, WCAG AA, 200ms transitions
- **User flows:** Onboarding → Test → Results → Explore; auth flows; career explorer search/filter

## When to Reference the Doc

- Adding or changing a feature → check PRD and feature list
- Touching API routes, DB, or types → follow schema and endpoint specs
- Styling or UI → follow Styling Guidelines and color/typography
- Fixing bugs → ensure behavior matches described user flows and E2E scenarios

Keep implementation consistent with `career_compass__all_documentation.md` unless the user explicitly requests a deviation.
